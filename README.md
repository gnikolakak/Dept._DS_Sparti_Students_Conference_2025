# 📘 Parameterized LLM-Based Assessment Generation

## 🔹 Introduction

Before proceeding with the analysis of the following code files, it is important to briefly outline the basic steps required for their execution. All scripts are implemented in Python, therefore a suitable development environment such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code is required. 

Additionally, the installation of the necessary libraries (e.g., OpenAI, PyPDF2, as well as libraries for mathematical computation and visualization) is required, along with a valid API key to access OpenAI services. Finally, input files (such as `.txt` or `.pdf`) should be located in the same directory as the code.

## 🔹 Project Description

This project presents a structured approach for generating assessment-oriented educational material using Large Language Models (LLMs).

Instead of relying on ad hoc prompting, a **parameterized pipeline** is applied, allowing controlled content generation through explicitly defined parameters such as:

- Number of questions  
- Difficulty level  
- Target audience  
- Domain  

In this way, the generated material is:

- Consistent  
- Repeatable  
- Pedagogically aligned  

LLMs are used as controlled generation tools rather than autonomous content creators, which is particularly important in technical domains such as Machine Learning.

## 🔹 Conceptual Workflow (Pipeline Overview)

The process followed in this project is not simply a sequence of execution steps, but a **parameterized pipeline for generating educational assessment material**.

Specifically, the system is based on the following stages:

1. **Parameter Specification**  
   The parameters (Q, A, CA, DL, TGA, DOM) are explicitly defined, determining the structure and difficulty of the assessment.

2. **Prompt Construction**  
   The parameters are embedded into a **structured prompt template**, which serves as the interface between the user and the LLM.  
   The prompt includes clear instructions, constraints, and output format requirements.

3. **Constrained Generation (LLM Execution)**  
   The LLM is used as a **conditional generator**, meaning it produces content strictly based on the defined constraints rather than acting as an autonomous creator.

4. **Output Structuring**  
   The generated material follows a predefined format:
   - Numbered questions  
   - Answer options  
   - One correct answer  
   - No explanations  

5. **Evaluation & Iteration**  
   The results are evaluated and, if necessary, refined through parameter adjustments or prompt improvements.

This process ensures:
- Control  
- Repeatability  
- Transparency

## 🔹 Additional Notes

- The pipeline is model-agnostic and can be applied to different LLM backends for comparative evaluation.
- In technical domains, strict correctness and adherence to formal definitions are critical, as even minor inaccuracies may lead to misconceptions.
- Optional supplementary material (e.g., theory, notes, or definitions) can be provided to the model to improve conceptual grounding and output quality.
